Description:
    The publishable generator creates new publishable object types, facilitating custom objects for specific purposes. The generated migration includes creation of a new PublishableType record and generates a default workflow governing its publication.

Example:
    rails generate publishable Article

    This will create:
          app/models/article.rb
          db/migrations/20120825201820_create_article.rb
